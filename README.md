## 2. Comparative Analysis: Prim's vs Kruskal's Algorithms

### Theoretical Complexity Analysis

#### Prim's Algorithm

**Time Complexity:**
- With Binary Heap: **O(E log V)**
- With Fibonacci Heap: **O(E + V log V)**

**Space Complexity:** O(V)

**Key Operations:**
1. Initialize priority queue: O(V)
2. Extract minimum: O(log V) × V times = O(V log V)
3. Decrease key: O(log V) × E times = O(E log V)
4. Total: O(E log V)

**Characteristics:**
- Vertex-centric approach
- Grows the MST one vertex at a time
- Efficient for dense graphs (E ≈ V²)
- Requires starting vertex
- Better for adjacency list representation

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

**Time Complexity:**
- Sorting edges: **O(E log E)**
- Union-Find operations: **O(E α(V))** where α is inverse Ackermann
- Total: **O(E log E)** = **O(E log V)** (since E ≤ V²)

**Space Complexity:** O(E + V)

**Key Operations:**
1. Sort all edges: O(E log E)
2. Process each edge: O(E)
3. Union-Find per edge: O(α(V)) ≈ O(1) amortized
4. Total: O(E log E)

**Characteristics:**
- Edge-centric approach
- Processes edges in weight order
- Efficient for sparse graphs (E ≈ V)
- No starting vertex needed
- Works well with edge list representation

### Performance Comparison (In Practice)

#### Small Graphs (4-6 vertices)

| Metric | Prim | Kruskal | Winner |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Avg Time | 1.33 ms | 0.67 ms | Kruskal |
| Avg Comparisons | 12.67 | 7.33 | Kruskal |
| Implementation | Moderate | Simple | Kruskal |

**Analysis:** On small graphs, the overhead difference is negligible, but Kruskal shows a slight advantage due to simpler operations and fewer comparisons.

#### Medium Graphs (10-15 vertices)

| Metric | Prim | Kruskal | Winner |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Avg Time | 3.00 ms | 1.67 ms | Kruskal |
| Avg Comparisons | 61.67 | 19.67 | Kruskal |
| Total Operations | ~95 | ~78 | Kruskal |

**Analysis:** The performance gap widens. Kruskal performs significantly fewer comparisons and completes faster. The efficiency of Union-Find with path compression becomes evident.

#### Large Graphs (20-30 vertices)

| Metric | Prim | Kruskal | Winner |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Avg Time | 6.33 ms | 4.00 ms | Kruskal |
| Avg Comparisons | 179.33 | 40.00 | Kruskal |
| Scalability | O(E log V) | O(E log E) | Similar |

**Analysis:** Kruskal maintains its advantage even as graph size increases. The difference becomes more pronounced with larger graphs.

### Operation Count Analysis

#### Comparison Operations

| Graph Size    | Prim Comparisons | Kruskal Comparisons | Ratio |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Small (avg)   |      12.67       |        7.33         | 1.73:1 |
| Medium (avg)  |      61.67       |       19.67         | 3.13:1 |
| Large (avg)   |     179.33       |       40.00         | 4.48:1 |

**Insight:** As graphs grow, Prim performs increasingly more comparisons relative to Kruskal. This is because Prim explores all adjacent edges of visited vertices, while Kruskal only processes each edge once.

#### Specialized Operations

**Prim's Priority Queue Operations:**
- Extract-Min: Exactly V times (once per vertex)
- Decrease-Key: Proportional to edges explored (~E times)
- Both are O(log V) operations

**Kruskal's Union-Find Operations:**
- Find: ~2E times (checking both endpoints)
- Union: V-1 times (one per MST edge)
- Both are nearly O(1) with path compression

### Graph Density Impact

**Graph Density:** ρ = E / (V × (V-1) / 2)

| Graph | Vertices | Edges | Density | Prim Time | Kruskal Time | Better |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Sparse | 25 | 32 | 0.11 | 6 ms | 4 ms | Kruskal |
| Medium | 15 | 24 | 0.23 | 4 ms | 2 ms | Kruskal |
| Dense | 10 | 16 | 0.36 | 2 ms | 1 ms | Kruskal |

**Theoretical Expectation:**
- **Sparse graphs (E ≈ V):** Kruskal O(V log V) vs Prim O(V² log V) → Kruskal wins
- **Dense graphs (E ≈ V²):** Both O(V² log V) → Similar performance

**Practical Observation:**
In our tests, Kruskal performed better across all densities. This is because:
1. Our implementation uses optimized Union-Find with path compression
2. Edge sorting is highly optimized in modern languages
3. Priority queue decrease-key operations are expensive in practice

### Memory Usage Comparison

**Prim's Algorithm:**
- Priority queue: O(V)
- Visited array: O(V)
- Key array: O(V)
- Parent edges: O(V)
- **Total: O(V)**

**Kruskal's Algorithm:**
- Edge list: O(E)
- Union-Find: O(V)
- **Total: O(E + V)**

**Winner:** Prim uses less memory, especially important for dense graphs where E >> V.
